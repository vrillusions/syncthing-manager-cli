# Syncthing Manager CLI

[![Project Status: Concept â€“ Minimal or no implementation has been done yet, or the repository is only intended to be a limited example, demo, or proof-of-concept.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/concept.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#concept)

Got tired of going to multiple installs and logging in to do things so start out with a basic CLI interface

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 - It may work on older versions but 3.6 is the version being developed on and primarily tested

## Setup

There is a `requirements.txt` file that contains all required modules.  Once you have a virtual environment setup of your choice do a `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
